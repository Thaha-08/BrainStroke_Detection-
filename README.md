 Brain Stroke Detection with Machine Learning

In this project, we aim to develop a robust brain stroke detection system employing various machine learning algorithms.
Our goal is to identify the algorithm that yields the highest accuracy in stroke detection. Ultimately, we have found that the Random Forest Classifier, following hyperparameter tuning,
delivers the best predictive performance.
Our brain stroke detection project demonstrates that the Random Forest Classifier, with careful hyperparameter tuning, is the most accurate machine learning algorithm for this critical task.
